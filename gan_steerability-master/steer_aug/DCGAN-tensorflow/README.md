# Note:

We are adding steerability to this original dcgan here:https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow The rest is just the original version. Here we provide the steerability for 2D rotation. Here we use the orignal code for the notebooks as well as the model_vanilla_rot2d.py and model_argminGW2_rot2d.py. We keep the output of the cells in the notebooks for clarity.
